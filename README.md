# Automated_Parking_System
If cars become driverless, why not the parking system. In Automated Parking System, the bot will park automatically in the parallel or vertical manner depending upon the slot length and width. If there is no parking slot available, then the car will come back to the entrance. To demonstrate this idea, a chassis model has been developed by using Arduino Mega, L293D motor shield and ultrasonic sensors. This project is made to make the parking process hustle free and reduce the
wastage of time.
